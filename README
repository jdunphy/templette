= Templette 0.2.1

A Ruby static HTML templating gem.

== Why?

Templette was created to help make creating static websites easy.  It provides a (hopefully) simple structure of pages, templates and helpers.  Templates are the universal page layouts.  Pages are the unique content of a page.

This is the worst readme ever.


== Use me

templette <site-name>

Generates a site folder.

rake build

Generates the full documents in an 'out' folder in the site root.
