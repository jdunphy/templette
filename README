= Templette 0.2.2

A Ruby static HTML templating gem.

== Why?

Templette was created to help make creating static websites easy.  It provides a (hopefully) simple structure of pages, templates and helpers.  Templates are the universal page layouts.  Pages are the unique content of a page.

This is the worst readme ever.


== Use me

templette <site-name>

Generates a site folder.

rake build

Generates the full documents in an 'out' folder in the site root.         

== Helper support

Automate content and avoid having to update transient information.  By default, a helper will automatically load a helper that shares its name.  Any methods loaded in the helper will be available to the template at build time.
